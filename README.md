# personal-coding-projects

Hi, I'm Krishna and here are all my coding projects that I deem worthy to put on the internet and not get laughed at. Been coding since 12, most stuff here is made for fun or made so I can understand an idea/logic (like ciphers and compression). Here the highlights (in my opinion) of this repo:

- chess (Py)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/chessInPython 

- optimized chess (cPP)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/chessInCpp

- RLE image compression (Py) (NEEDS PIL/pillow installed)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/losslessImageCompression

- Graphing calculator (Py)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/graphingCalculatorPy

- Caesar cipher + cracker (Py)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/caesarCipherCrackerAndEncryptor

- RSS for F1iS (Py)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/raceSimulationSystemPy

- Rock,Paper,Scissors with GUI (Py)=  https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/tree/main/RockPaperScissorsPy
