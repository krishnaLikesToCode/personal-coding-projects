Hi, i'm Krishna Bhat and here are all my coding projects that i deem workthy to put on the internet and not get laughed at. Been coding since y8, most stuff here is made for fun or made so i can understand an idea/logic (like ciphers and compression). Here the highlights (in my opinion) of this repo:

- RLE image compression (Py) (NEEDS PIL/pillow installed)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/blob/main/RLE_image_compression.py

- Graphing calculator (Py)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/blob/main/graphing_calculator.py

- Caesar cipher + cracker (Py)= https://github.com/krishnaLikesToCode/personal-coding-projects/blob/main/caesar_cipher_encrypt_and_cracker.py
